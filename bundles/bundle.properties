#Inverse Pulverizer
block.inverse-InversePulverizer.name = Inverse Pulverizer
block.inverse-InversePulverizer.description = It turns the sand into scrap metal, wasting energy.\n[red]Do not build an inverse and conventional shredder next to each other![]
block.inverse-InversePulverizer.details = I do not know how it works...
#Inverse Melter
block.inverse-InverseMelter.name = Inverse Melter
block.inverse-InverseMelter.description = It cools the hot slag to get a chilled version of it, that is, scrap metal.\n[red]Do not build an inverse and an ordinary smelter next to each other![]
block.inverse-InverseMelter.details = I do not know where it can be applied, but somewhere it is definitely possible...Probably...I really hope...
#Inverse Coal Centrifuge
block.inverse-InverseCoalCentrifuge.name = Inverse Coal Centrifuge
block.inverse-InverseCoalCentrifuge.description = Turns lumps of coal back into crude oil by consuming energy.Useful thing when there is not too much oil on the map.\n[red]Do not build an inverse and a conventional coal centrifuge next to each other![]
block.inverse-InverseCoalCentrifuge.details = Ummm...Well...Most likely it cools the coal somehow or something..?
#Inverse Spore Press
block.inverse-InverseSporePress.name = Inverse Spore Press
block.inverse-InverseSporePress.description = Crude oil condenses very quickly to form spore pods.\n[red]Dont put inverted and normal spore press next to each other![]
block.inverse-InverseSporePress.details = Lasts longer than a conventional spore press to condense the pods
